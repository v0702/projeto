        <p>Sure, Angus of AC/DC probably even takes his to bed, and also the young Eric Clapton - at that time with Cream - as well as Mick Taylor with the Rolling Stones, who used an SG and created a good many classics. Not quite as tight in the bass as its sister Paula, but very lively and also aggressive. Blues sounds can also be elicited - especially with the pickup in the neck. On these points, the G400 comes very close to the much more expensive original. Add to all that the appearance: Mahogany in cherry red, and that's about it!
        By the way, this is perfect for those who want an additional instrument for playing slide guitar - Duane Allmann knew this all too well</p>
